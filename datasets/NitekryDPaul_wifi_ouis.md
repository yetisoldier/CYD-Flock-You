# Flock Safety WiFi OUIs — Research by @NitekryDPaul

**Researcher:** OrdoOuroborous (**@NitekryDPaul**, GitHub [@nitekry](https://github.com/nitekry))

This dataset documents Flock Safety and related surveillance-infrastructure WiFi MAC-address OUIs (first three octets) discovered through 2.4 GHz promiscuous-mode analysis. The 42 active prefixes below come from @NitekryDPaul's promiscuous-mode research on Flock camera air traffic (41) and Michael / DeFlockJoplin's wildcard-probe drive-testing (1). Upstream OUI source: [nitekry/nite-oui-collection](https://github.com/nitekry/nite-oui-collection). One prefix from the original set (`f8:a2:d6`) has been demoted — see the [Demoted](#demoted--low-confidence) section.

## Why promiscuous mode

Flock stations spend most of their duty cycle asleep, waking briefly to upload and then sleeping again. During the sleep windows a passive sniffer will never see them transmit — but it can still see them named as the **destination** (addr1) of probe responses and data frames from nearby APs. Matching on addr1 in addition to addr2 therefore reveals devices that a transmitter-only sniff would miss entirely.

This addr1 technique is @NitekryDPaul's discovery and is the basis of the `promiscuis-flock-you` firmware.

## OUI list (42 prefixes, lowercase, colon-separated)

@NitekryDPaul contributed 41 active prefixes — 29 from his original
promiscuous-mode set plus 12 from his April 2026 additions in
[nite-oui-collection](https://github.com/nitekry/nite-oui-collection).
The 42nd (`82:6b:f2`) was contributed by **Michael / DeFlockJoplin** during
follow-up drive-testing in Joplin — it's the OUI of the 12th camera in his
field test, which the original list didn't catch. See
[DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## Flagged but still tracked

These prefixes remain in the active firmware OUI array but have a known
caveat documented by @NitekryDPaul.

| Prefix | Caveat | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `08:3a:88` | BLE Ring conflict — expect occasional Ring-doorbell false positives when this OUI is matched against BLE advertisements. WiFi-side detection is unaffected. Flagged per @NitekryDPaul's latest [my_tested_flock.md](https://github.com/nitekry/nite-oui-collection/blob/main/groups/flockers/my_tested_flock.md) update (2026-05-13). | @NitekryDPaul |

## Demoted / low confidence

These prefixes were in earlier revisions of the list but have been removed
from the active firmware OUI array.

| Prefix | Reason | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `f8:a2:d6` | Low confidence; observed hitting a Sony Media Player rather than a Flock device. Demoted per @NitekryDPaul's [my_tested_flock.md](https://github.com/nitekry/nite-oui-collection/blob/main/groups/flockers/my_tested_flock.md) field notes. | @NitekryDPaul |
| `cc:cc:cc` | No observed hits across @NitekryDPaul's testing. Originally a placeholder/test prefix from the early GainSec list; never produced a real detection. | @NitekryDPaul |
| `00:0c:e7` | MediaTek prefix that appeared in early field tests as a possible Flock-adjacent observation; later determined to be a likely false positive. | @NitekryDPaul / Crowdsource |

## Detection strategy

For each observed 802.11 management or data frame:

1. Skip if multicast (addr1 byte 0 bit 0 set) — filters broadcasts, 33:33:* groups, etc.
2. Skip if locally-administered (byte 0 bit 1 set) — filters randomised MACs
3. Match `addr2` (transmitter) against the OUI list
4. Match `addr1` (receiver) against the OUI list — **the addr1 insight**
5. Optional: match `addr3` (BSSID) on mgmt frames when addr2 is randomised

### Wildcard-probe tightening (DeFlockJoplin)

Michael / DeFlockJoplin observed that Flock cameras channel-hop and spam
wildcard 802.11 Probe Requests on every channel. Combining that with the
OUI match yields a very tight signature:

1. Frame is Management, type=0 subtype=4 (Probe Request)
2. SSID Information Element (tag 0) is present with length 0
3. `addr2` (transmitter) matches the OUI list

Field-tested in Joplin: **11 of 12 cameras caught with only 2 false
positives**. The 12th camera used OUI `82:6b:f2`, which is now in the
list above. Source: [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## Firmware

The `promiscuis-flock-you` firmware implementing this research is a mod of @NitekryDPaul's promiscuous-mode firmware. It emits Flask-compatible JSON over USB for ingestion by the `flock-you` dashboard and persists detections to on-device SPIFFS.
