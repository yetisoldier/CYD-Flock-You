## Credit

All WiFi promiscuous detection research — the **30-OUI target list**, the **promiscuous-mode strategy**, and the **addr1-receiver detection technique** — is the work of **ØяĐöØцяöЪöяцฐ / @NitekryDPaul**. The firmware here is a mod of his original firmware with added SPIFFS persistence and Flask-dashboard integration. Full research writeup: [`datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md`](datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md).

Additional research credit to **Michael / DeFlockJoplin** for the **wildcard-probe-request signature** and the 31st OUI (`82:6b:f2`). Field-tested to 11/12 cameras caught with only 2 false positives in Joplin. Source: [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you).

## What this branch does

Turns a Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 into a passive WiFi receiver that watches 2.4 GHz management and data frames for Flock Safety MAC OUIs. No AP, no transmit — the radio stays dedicated to sniffing while the device hops channels 1 / 6 / 11 at 350 ms dwell.

Every detection is:

- beeped (piezo on GPIO3) and flashed (onboard LED on GPIO21)
- written to on-device SPIFFS in an atomic CRC-envelope format, surviving power loss
- emitted as one JSON line over USB CDC in the schema `api/flockyou.py` expects, so the Flask dashboard auto-ingests it with GPS temporal matching

The device works standalone (no USB host needed) and plugged in (live dashboard) without any mode switch.

## Why promiscuous mode, and why `addr1`

Most WiFi sniffers only check the transmitter address (`addr2`). Flock infrastructure spends most of its duty cycle **asleep** — it wakes briefly in bursts, uploads, then sleeps again. During the silence it may never transmit a single frame in your capture window.

But it may still appear on the air as the **destination** (`addr1`) of probe responses or data frames from nearby APs.

Checking `addr1` in addition to `addr2` picks those silent stations up. It requires two guards to avoid false positives:

- `addr1` is broadcast (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff`) in beacons and broadcasts — **multicast filter**
- Modern devices use randomised (locally-administered) MACs that can't be fingerprinted by OUI — **randomised-MAC filter** on byte 0 bit 1

Both are applied before the OUI match. This whole approach, including the 30-OUI list, is **@NitekryDPaul's research**.

---

## Further research — the wildcard-probe signature (DeFlockJoplin)

Michael / DeFlockJoplin used the OUI + addr1/addr2/addr3 work above as a starting point and characterised what Flock cameras actually do on the air. His finding:

> The cameras are hopping channels and sending out a wildcard WiFi probe request on every channel. This specific type of request combined with OUI matching has created what seems to be a fairly unique signature.

His drive-test in Joplin caught **11 of 12 cameras** with only **2 false positives**. The 12th camera was doing the same wildcard-probe behaviour but with an OUI (`82:6b:f2`) that wasn't in @NitekryDPaul's original 30 — it's now the 31st entry in our list, credited to him.

The tightened signature that's active on this branch:

1. Frame is 802.11 Management, type=0 subtype=4 (**Probe Request**)
2. SSID Information Element (tag 0) is present with **length 0** (wildcard)
3. `addr2` (transmitter) matches the known-OUI list

When all three hit, we emit `detection_method: wifi_wildcard_probe` — the high-precision class. Non-probe frames from the same OUIs still emit `wifi_oui_addr2`, and the `addr1` receiver-side sleeper-catch still runs independently.

His proof-of-concept firmware (different enough we're not just pulling it in wholesale, but the core idea carried over cleanly): [DeflockJoplin/flock-you](https://github.com/DeflockJoplin/flock-you). The wildcard-probe analysis is his; we ported the detection into this firmware and kept our SPIFFS persistence, Flask JSON emission, and audio/LED feedback on top.

## Detection pipeline

```
  [2.4GHz air]
       │
       ▼
  wifiSniffer()                 ← IRAM promiscuous callback (WiFi task)
       │                          fast match only, no Serial / no malloc
       ▼
  alertQueue[32]                ← lock-free ring buffer (ISR-safe mux)
       │
       ▼
  drainAlertQueue()             ← loop() context, per-iteration drain
       │
       ├─► fyAddDetection()           ← always, every hit
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fyDet[200]                 ← unique-by-MAC on-device table
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   autosaveTick()             ← every 60s when dirty
       │        │
       │        ▼
       │   fySaveSession()            ← atomic CRC-envelope write to SPIFFS
       │
       ├─► shouldSuppressDuplicate()  ← 5s per-MAC serial-emit rate limit
       │
       └─► emitDetectionJSON()        ← USB CDC line for Flask
            buzzerBeep() + ledFlash()
```

The split between callback and loop is deliberate: the WiFi task has hard real-time constraints and cannot call `Serial.print` or `malloc` safely. The callback writes only to the lock-free ring buffer; `loop()` does all the heavy work.

## OUI target list (@NitekryDPaul research)

All lowercase, colon-separated. 31 Flock Safety infrastructure prefixes:

```
70:c9:4e   3c:91:80   d8:f3:bc   80:30:49   b8:35:32
14:5a:fc   74:4c:a1   08:3a:88   9c:2f:9d   c0:35:32

82:6b:f2   ← contributed by Michael / DeFlockJoplin
```

Pre-compiled into a byte table in `setup()` so the matcher stays entirely in IRAM with no flash-resident lookups during callback execution.

Full dataset and methodology: [`datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md`](datasets/NitekryDPaul_wifi_ouis.md).

## SPIFFS wire format

On-flash layout, atomic and crash-safe:

```
Line 1: {"v":1,"count":N,"bytes":B,"crc":"0xXXXXXXXX"}
Line 2: [{"mac":"...","method":"...","rssi":...,...},...]
```

Save procedure:

1. Compute CRC32 + byte count over the serialised payload
2. Write envelope header + payload to `/session.tmp`
3. Re-read and re-validate `/session.tmp` (CRC check)
4. Remove `/session.json`
5. Atomic rename `/session.tmp` → `/session.json` (copy+delete fallback)

Boot recovery:

1. If `/session.json` validates, promote it to `/prev_session.json`
2. Otherwise try `/session.tmp` (interrupted save)
3. Delete both working files, start with an empty live table
4. `/prev_session.json` stays around for inspection

CRC32 uses the standard `0xEDB88320` polynomial so the same file can be verified on a host with any off-the-shelf CRC tool.

---

## Flask dashboard integration

The firmware emits one JSON line per detection in the same schema the BLE detector uses, so `api/flockyou.py` picks it up with zero changes:

```json
{"event":"detection","detection_method":"wifi_oui_addr2","protocol":"wifi_2_4ghz","mac_address":"aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff","oui":"aa:bb:cc","device_name":"","rssi":-62,"channel":6,"frequency":2437,"ssid":""}
```

`detection_method` values:

- `wifi_wildcard_probe` — **Probe Request + wildcard SSID from a known OUI** (the DeFlockJoplin high-precision signature). When this fires, the `addr2` broad alert is suppressed for the same frame to avoid double-counting.
- `wifi_oui_addr2` — transmitter-side OUI match on any non-probe frame
- `wifi_oui_addr1` — **receiver-side OUI match** (the @NitekryDPaul technique)
- `wifi_oui_addr3` — BSSID OUI match (mgmt frames only; disabled by default)
- `wifi_ssid` — SSID keyword match (disabled by default)

### GPS wardriving

GPS is handled Flask-side, since the ESP32 radio is dedicated to sniffing and there's no on-device AP. Two options:

- **USB NMEA puck** plugged into the host running Flask — Flask reads NMEA and timestamps a GPS timeline
- **Flask dashboard open in a phone browser** — browser Geolocation API posts updates to Flask

Flask does a temporal match between detection timestamp and GPS timeline, then exports JSON / CSV / KML for Google Earth.

### Running Flask

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flockyou.py
```

Open `http://localhost:5000`, pick your serial port from the UI, detections start showing up live.

## Hardware

**Primary board:** Cheap Yellow Display / ESP32-2432S028R

CYD support adds a TFT status UI, SD-card CSV logging, and a Bluetooth LE UART pairing protocol for the DeFlock Android fork. The phone supplies GPS over BLE; the CYD stays focused on passive WiFi detection. USB serial remains useful for flashing, bench monitoring, and protocol debugging.

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO 4 | Red RGB LED detection feedback, active low |
| GPIO 5 | SD card CS |
| GPIO 12 | TFT MISO |
| GPIO 13 | TFT MOSI |
| GPIO 14 | TFT SCLK |
| GPIO 15 | TFT CS |
| GPIO 2 | TFT DC |
| GPIO 21 | TFT backlight |
| GPIO 26 | Piezo buzzer |
| GPIO 0 | Screen cycle button |

**Legacy board:** Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3

| Pin | Function |
|-----|----------|
| GPIO 3 | Piezo buzzer |
| GPIO 21 | Onboard user LED (active low) |
| GPIO 43 | Serial1 TX mirror (115200 baud) |

Boot sound: first 6 notes of Super Mario Bros. World 1-2 (underground).

## Build and flash

Requires [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).

```bash
pio run -e cyd              # build CYD firmware
pio run -e cyd -t upload    # flash CYD firmware
pio device monitor          # serial output
```

Shortcut:

```bash
./scripts/flash-cyd.sh
```

The XIAO target is still available:

```bash
pio run -e xiao_esp32s3
```

`platformio.ini`, `partitions.csv`, and `partitions_cyd.csv` are at the root. The CYD build uses TFT_eSPI and TinyGPSPlus in addition to the Arduino-ESP32 core.

---

## DeFlock Android pairing

Power the CYD separately, then use DeFlock's Bluetooth button to connect to the `CYD-Flock-You` BLE peripheral. The firmware exposes the Nordic UART service:

- Service: `6E400001-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- RX/write: `6E400002-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`
- TX/notify: `6E400003-B5A3-F393-E0A9-E50E24DCCA9E`

CYD emits a pairing status JSON line every 5 seconds and responds to `FYHELLO`. A paired DeFlock fork should stream phone GPS with `FYGPS,<lat>,<lon>,<accuracy_m>,<speed_kmph>,<course_deg>,<sats>,<hdop>` and listen for `event:"detection"` JSON.

The intended app flow is review-first:

- queue a candidate when CYD detects a target and no surveillance node exists within 250 feet / 76.2 meters
- place the first marker at the phone GPS coordinate
- require the user to drag the marker to the roadside camera position
- require the user to set camera direction manually
- only then queue the normal DeFlock upload for user approval

Full protocol notes are in [`docs/deflock-pairing-protocol.md`](docs/deflock-pairing-protocol.md).

The companion DeFlock fork lives locally at `/home/yetisoldier/projects/deflock-cyd-app` on branch `cyd-flock-you-integration`. It connects over BLE UART, parses CYD events, queues review candidates, applies the 250-foot duplicate suppression rule, and opens DeFlock's normal map-based add flow for manual roadside placement and camera direction.

## Standalone vs connected

**Without USB:** device boots, plays the SMB 1-2 intro, starts scanning, stores every unique detection to SPIFFS, flashes the onboard LED on each hit. Plug in later — the prior session is sitting in `/prev_session.json`.

**With USB + Flask running:** same thing, plus every detection streams live to the dashboard as a JSON line. Flask adds GPS (if configured) and deduplicates across MAC, building the wardriving map as you move.

Both modes work simultaneously — the SPIFFS write path doesn't care if a host is listening.

---

## BLE companion firmware

The BLE-only sibling of this firmware lives on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/flock-you/tree/main). It detects Flock and Raven gear via BLE advertisements (OUI prefix, device name, manufacturer ID `0x09C8`, Raven service UUIDs), runs its own WiFi AP with a phone-facing dashboard at `192.168.4.1`, and emits the same Flask JSON schema. Flash both on separate boards for overlapping BLE + WiFi coverage feeding one Flask dashboard.
